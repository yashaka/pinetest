Pinetest
========

Description
-----------
Pinetest is an implementation of an automation test framework based mainly on Selenium and HtmlElements frameworks.
It serves to test [Pine](www.pine-project.org), a tool to help you to store, manage and use input data for the automation tests.
Its [core](https://github.com/yashaka/pinetest/tree/master/src/main/java/org/pineproject/pinetest/core) part (package org.pineproject.pinetest.core) can be used separately to implement the same approaches for automation testing of other web applications.
As soon as it become a mature one, it can be moved to a separate library and shared to the world wide.

For more information about the implementation see [worklog](https://github.com/yashaka/pinetest/blob/master/worklog.yml).
